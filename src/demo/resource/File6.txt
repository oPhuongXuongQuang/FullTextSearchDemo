A car bomb blast has hit a police headquarters in south-eastern Turkey, killing five people and injuring at least 39, officials say.
A woman and a baby are among the dead. Rescuers are continuing to search through rubble at the scene in Cinar district, Diyarbakir province.
Officials blamed the blast on Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) militants, who are active in the mainly Kurdish province.
No group has so far said it carried out the attack.
The bomb was detonated at the entrance of the Cinar district police complex, officials say. The blast also damaged nearby residential buildings, where the mother and baby were killed.
The attackers then reportedly fired rockets at the headquarters.
Another police station, in Midyat town, in neighbouring Mardin province, was also attacked by militants, according to Turkish media, but there are no reports of casualties.
