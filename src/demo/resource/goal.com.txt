The Espanyol defender revealed what was said on the pitch between him and the Barcelona star during Wednesday's Copa del Rey second-leg


Alvaro Gonzalez has revealed that Lionel Messi told him he thought the Espanyol defender would hurt him during Wednesday's Copa del Rey game.

Barcelona beat their Catalan rivals 2-0 in the second leg of their round-of-16 tie in a match which saw seven yellow cards given out.

The return leg was a much tamer affair compared to the first instalment between the two rivals, in which Espanyol had two men sent off in a 4-1 loss. 

However, after Gonzalez had fouled Messi in the second leg, the two exchanged insults and laughed about it.
