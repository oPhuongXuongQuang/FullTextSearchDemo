At least seven blasts were heard in Indonesia’s capital Jakarata late Thursday morning leaving seven, including four attackers, dead.
The first blast reportedly took place at a Starbucks cafe in Jalan Thamrin across Sarinah Plaza. The second blast took place outside a a police kiosk located near the Sarinah mall. There is no confirmation as yet on whether the third blast that took place in that locality was a grenade or a suicide bomber. No organisation has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Indonesian network TVOne reports that besides the blasts near Sarinah mall, three other blasts took place at Cikni, Silpi and Kuningan neighborhoods, near the Turkish and Pakistani embassies. However, police have now said that the reports were rumours sent out by the terrorists on social media.
The police claims also seven blasts took place in the vicinity of each other.
“We have previously received a threat from Islamic State that Indonesia will be the spotlight,” police spokesman Anton Charliyan told reporters. But he said police did not know who was responsible.
